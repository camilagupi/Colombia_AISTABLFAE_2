# Colombia_AISTABLFAE_2

This project contains code used to predict forest conversion risk in Colombia as part of the paper 
"An investment strategy to address biodiversity loss from agricultural expansion".

First script: Deforestation_model_pub.R
- Code used to 
- * fit a binomial logistic regression model on the spatial variables considered in the study.
- * predict forest conversion risk.

Second script: k-fold cross-validation_pub.R
- Code used to implement the 10-fold cross-validation to test model accuracy.
